# Circle UX
### This is the pre-alpha version of my upcoming Beautiful Music App, Circle! If you don't know how to use it, there's a tutorial button in the top right. This gives an idea of how beautiful the USER EXPERIENCE will be!!
#### Could you make sure to try that lyrics section too? (it's beautiful!)
### It's supposed to be a mobile app so that desktop ppl will get a smartphone frame... Use your mouse instead of your finger... ;)

# How to use it:
